sunshine_meter
==============

Raspberry PI + webcam to check how much sunshine (brightness) we get during the year.

The idea is to make a webcam-picture every hour, store it and process it.
Storing allows for cool time-lapse (GIF) movies.
Processing means brightness (and color) extraction to put to a nice graph of sunshine.

In fact the experiment is to prove that in Belgium we get grey weather all year round...
